The `data-bodily-distress-psyctr` dataset is based on a network meta-analysis on cognitive behavioral interventions and acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions for adults with bodily distress. The dataset contains study information and effect size data of randomized controlled trials that report the effect of cognitive behavioral as well as acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions on somatic symptom severity, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, health anxiety, and perceived health status. The dataset also contains information about negative effects and treatment satisfaction. This dataset includes psychotherapy versus control (`psy vs ctr`) comparisons. The date of the last search update is provided [here](https://github.com/metapsy-project/data-bodily-distress-psyctr/blob/main/metadata/last_search.txt). The results of the network meta-analysis can be found in [this published article](https://karger.com/pps/article/94/3/207/922147/Efficacy-of-Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy-and?searchresult=1).

The dataset follows the [Metapsy data standard](https://docs.metapsy.org/data-preparation/format/). All included information has been independently extracted by two researchers. Risk of bias ratings were conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool 2 (RoB 2). Re-ratings using the Metapsy Risk of Bias tool are currently ongoing.
